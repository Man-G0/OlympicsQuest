# Olympics Quest
## Description
The idea is to find an activity to do near an Olympic event. Ideally, even creating a map with geolocation to see all nearby places would be perfect.

On the home page of the application, users can find all the Olympic events and search for theirs. After selecting it, they will be directed to the second page where all the activities and good addresses near the event will be displayed. This way, when they have to wait between events or simply want to explore the city at the end of their day, they will have all the addresses quickly. This will help them avoid using transportation too often, which can be expensive during that time.

We used Android studio, kotlin and jetpack compose. 
We used a firebase realtime data set we created and an API connection to find interesting spots around a geographic point in Paris.
